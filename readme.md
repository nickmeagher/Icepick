# Primer - WordPress Starter Theme with Boostrap

This starter theme is really a personalized version of [Bones](https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones). I love bones but I find that some of the templates are a little cluttered and I also use Bootstrap for almost everything I do so I figured I would include that as well. If you find any issues or want to improve on it, feel free to submit a pull request!

## Installation

Clone the repo right into your themes folder and you're good to go!

`git clone https://github.com/nickmeagher/Primer`
